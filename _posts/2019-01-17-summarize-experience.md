Started as software developer, grew up into a development manager, moved into product management and then extending onto strategy and execution as well. Over so many years, I have gained experience of working in India, Mexico, Ecuador, different parts of US, different organizations - BofA, Vanguard, AIG, Banco Pichincha. I have also been a strategic advisor for many of the CIOs, helping them to make decisions on the right software product for cloud, AI, data, analytics. Innovator with 4 patents, and have often built teams from ground up. I keep participating in case competitions to keep myself up to speed. Over the last 6-7 years, i have delivered keynote in various conferences across US with technology and its application focused on solving real world business problems.

Recently in Wells Fargo, i am part of their technology strategy and innovation, providing advisory types of support to the CTO and CIOs on emerging technology trends, i have completed my OKRs within 5 months of joining with 'Exceeding the meets' appraisal. Before that, I have delivered $23M of cost saves for enterprises including BofA, AIG, Banco Pichincha, Transamerica by implementing my AI based products against a target save of $20M per year. I was part of the 3 member team to conceptualize the products, launch them, work with engineering teams to build them and take them to enterprise clients.
